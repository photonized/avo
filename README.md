### Founders: Amit, Vlad, Omer
#### Based in: uOttawa
#### Language Used: Node JS

#### What is it?
  AVO is a project made by 3 friends at the university of Ottawa with the goal of helping them learn about the blockchain environment. The blockchain is created from the ground up using JavaScript as the base language. This means that AVO does not depend on any environment, such as the Ethereum Blockchain. Once AVO is created, a coin will be added onto it, called the AVO Coin. The current status of the blockchain is: *LOCAL*, *CENTRALIZED*.
